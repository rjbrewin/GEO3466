    "In this practical we will learn how to estimate primary production in the ocean using an available-light model of photosynthesis, by making some assumptions on the parameters of the photosynthesis irradiance equation, and using two input variables that can be derived from satellite ocean-colour data: the chlorophyll-a concentration (a measure of phytoplankton biomass, denoted $B$) and photosynthetically available radiation (PAR).\n",

This classical relationship (Platt et al. 1980) lies at the heart of models of ocean primary production.\n",

    "In the above sections, we have introduced all the key components required to compute primary production: the chlorophyll-a concentration ($B$), light ($I$), and the assimilation number ($P^B_{m}$) and initial slope ($\\alpha^B$) of the light-saturation curve (Figure 1). However, these components are not static, but vary in time and depth, and with wavelength in the case of $I$ and $\\alpha^B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of simplicity, in this practical we make the following assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We deal with total light (PAR), without taking into account spectral variations in light or the spectral selectivity in absorption and utilisation of light for photosynthesis.\n",
    "- The chlorophyll-a concentration ($B$), the assimilation number ($P^B_{m}$) and inital slope ($\\alpha^B$) remains constant over the period of one day.\n",
    "- The chlorophyll-a concentration ($B$), the assimilation number ($P^B_{m}$) and inital slope ($\\alpha^B$) are constant with depth. This follows the case of a vertically homogeneous water column (no deep chlorophyll-a maximum), and assumes phytoplankton are adapted to the average light conditions in sun-lit region of the ocean).\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, there are clear cases where these assumptions do not hold. However, there are situations where it is reasonable to make these assumptions. One important factor to consider however, when modelling primary production, is variations in light with time ($t$) over the day period, and depth ($z$). \n",

    "### Variations in light with depth and time\n",
    "\n",
    "Photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) is a standard product produced by space agencies (see https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/dataprod/par.php). It represents total available irradiance from 400 to 700 nanometers just above the water surface. This value is typically provided by space agencies in Einstein m$^{-2}$ d$^{-1}$, representing integrated irradiance over the daylength ($D$). \n",
    "\n",
    "To go from PAR to $I(z,t)$, we convert PAR from Einstein m$^{-2}$ d$^{-1}$ into $\\mu$mol m$^{-2}$ d$^{-1}$, then estimate the surface maximum irradiance just above the water surface ($I_m(0+)$) at mid-day according to \n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $D$ is daylength (in seconds). To account for the transmission of light at the air-sea water interface, we subtract 2% (reflected light) from $I_m(0+)$ to get from above to below water ($I_m(0-)$). This number (2%) is relatively constant for sun-zenith angles from 0 to 40$^{\\circ}$, typically observed at local noon in the tropics, but increases with sun-zenith angle and is impacted by wind speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having derived $I_m(0-)$, the values of irradiance $I(0-,t)$ at various time steps ($t$) during the day, just below the air-sea interface, can then be computed according to \n",

The value of $K_d$ is dependent on the optical properties of the water, and is a product provided as standard by space agencies and covaries with $B$ in open-ocean waters. In cases of a non-uniform profile of phytoplankton, $K_d$ will vary with depth. But following our assumption of a homogeneous water column, in this practical, we can make the assumption of a constant $K_d$ (as we did with $B$).\n",

    "Having run the code, Figure 6 shows a map of primary production for the 4th June 2023 around the south-west UK, Ireland and northern France. Land and clouds are shown in white (note the resolution of the data is quite course, 9 km). High primary production is observed around the coastlines of Plymouth and northern France. We also can see a bloom off the coastline of Plymouth in the English Channel.\n",

    "## Further work\n",
    "\n",
    "Having completed the practical, here are some additional tasks you may want to do in your own time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Try plotting different regions of the ocean by changing the bounds \"Max_lon\", \"Min_lon\", \"Max_lat\" and \"Min_lat\". Note however, the bigger the area, the longer the code will take to run (a complete global image will take a very long time to run). An example that works well on the above image (4th June 2023) is Max_lon = 16.0,  Min_lon = 12.0, Max_lat = -22.0,  Min_lat = -26.0, off the coastline of Namibia.\n",
    "- Try varying model parameters (PB_M and AL_B) and see what results you get. The assumption here is that these parameters are static. There are ways we try and estimate the parameters dynamically from space too, to account for the variability (see for instance Saux-Picart et al. 2014). Ultimately, it would be good to integrate these functions into the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this practical you have learnt how to estimate primary production in the ocean using an available-light model of photosynthesis. You have used satellite ocean colour data (specifically the chlorophyll-a concentration and photosynthetically available radiation) to map primary production in time (over a seasonal cycle at a specific location) and in space (around the south-west UK). The model is a fairly simple one, and it is important to acknowledge the assumptions in the model when analysing data output. \n",
    "\n",
    "You should now have a better understanding of what controls primary production, how to estimate primary production using satellite data, and have now gained more experience as a Python coder."
