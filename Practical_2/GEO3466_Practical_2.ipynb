    "## Aims of the Practical and Intended Learning Outcomes\n",
    "\n",

    "We begin by introducing the classical Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model (Lotka 1925, Volterra, 1926a,b). The model describes the interaction between two populations in a biological system, the predator ($Z$, taken here to be zooplankton) and the prey ($P$, taken here to be phytoplankton), using the following two differential equations\n",

    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{d Z}{d t} = \\delta PZ - \\gamma Z,\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where, $\\frac{d P}{d t}$ represent the exponential growth of phytoplankton, $\\frac{d Z}{d t}$ the growth of zooplankton, $\\alpha$ is the net growth rate of the phytoplankton, $\\gamma$ is the death rate of the zooplankton, and $\\beta$ and $\\delta$ are positive parameters describing the interactions between the two populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model makes a series of assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The phytoplankton population has amply resources (nutrients and light) at all times.\n",
    "- The supply of food to zooplankton depends entirely on the size of the phytoplankton population.\n",
    "- The rate of change of phytoplankton and zooplankton is proportional to their size.\n",
    "- The environment never changes in favour of one species (no genetic adaptation).\n",
    "- Zooplankton have a limitless appetite.\n",
    "- There is no time difference from when zooplankton consume phytoplankton and convert them to new zooplankton.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other assumptions exist as well, and many of these assumptions are not realistic. Nonetheless, these equations have proven useful in biological oceanography (and ecology more generally).\n",
    "\n",
    "The differential equations have no explicate solution, and so interactions are approximated by finite-difference equations, where a time increment is repeatedly applied to make sequential calculations (Miller & Wheeler, 2012). This is referred to as the Euler's method, which is a first-order numerical procedure designed to solve differential equations with a given initial value. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin by implementing these equations in Python in a hypothetical case. To do this we:\n",
    "- Define the time steps. For this example, we are going to run the model for 100 days at hourly time-steps.\n",
    "- We then set-up the vectors for $P$, $Z$ and time.\n",
    "- We then define some parameters for our model, for $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $\\delta$ and $\\gamma$.\n",
    "- We provide initial starting conditions for phytoplankton and zooplankton. We start by satisfying steady state conditions, where $\\frac{d P}{dt}$ = $\\frac{d Z}{dt}$ = 0, and we can assume $P = \\gamma/\\delta$ and $Z = \\alpha/\\beta$.\n",
    "- Given the parameters are daily values, we divide by 24 (steps) to convert to hourly.\n",
    "- We then loop though each day and hour (step) and solve our differential equations using the Euler's method.\n",
    "- Finally, we plot a time-series of the results \n",

    "Let us run these equations and look at the output graphically using Python. Run the following lines of Python code."

Like the previous NZP model, this model also accounts for other controls on phytoplankton, including nutrient limitation and zooplankton grazing.

    "Figure 8 shows the classical seasonal cycle in subpolar regions (~47 degrees N): \n",
    "- Light highest in the summer and lowest in the winter. \n",
    "- Mixed-layer is shallowest in the summer, deepest late winter. It shoals sharply in spring, and steadily deepens in autumn.\n",
    "- Phytoplankton bloom in spring (April), are low in summer, there is a (very small) fall bloom, and stocks are lowest over the winter.\n",
    "- Nutrients cycles are inverse to phytoplankton.\n",
    "- Zooplankton bring down the phytoplankton bloom in spring and remain high over the summer. \n",
    "- Phytoplankton growth (bottom figure) is light limited in the winter (minimum of the two factors) and nutrient limited (minimum of the two factors) in the summer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, these results look relatively good. However, how sensitive is the model to changes in parameters? Why not have a play with the code to see? For example, if you change the grazing rate (c = 0.35 in the code above) from 0.35 to 0.6 you will eliminate the spring bloom and just cause oscillations over summer, as higher grazing pressure prevents the bloom developing (this is thought to partly reflect why blooms rarely occur in low-latitude regions).\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this practical you have learnt how to use numerical ecosystem modelling to explore the interactions between phytoplankton, zooplankton and their environment. You have learnt how to use two different types of models, a predator-prey model, and an NPZ model. \n",
    "\n",
    "You should now have a better understanding of what numerical ecosystem modelling is all about, how to implement a basic predator-prey model and NPZ models, how you use these ecosystem model to test ecological questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional information on numerical ecosystem modelling is provided in Lecture 6 of GEO3466: \"Numerical Ecosystem Modelling\". For further details on numerical models, I also recommend reading Chapter 4 of Miller & Wheeler (2012), much of which this practical is based on. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Further reading (more sophisticated ecosystem models)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you would like to learn about even more sophisticated ecosystem models, there is an excellent book by Fennel and Neumann (2014), and also I suggest reading page 85-95 of Chapter 4 of Miller & Wheeler (2012)."
